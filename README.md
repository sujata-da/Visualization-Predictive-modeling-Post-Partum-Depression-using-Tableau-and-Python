# Visualization-Predictive-modeling-Post-Partum-Depression-using-Tableau-and-Python
This repository contains my Tableau project on Postpartum Depression, showcasing its complexities visually. I've developed a machine learning model to predict suicidal risk in new mothers based on PPD symptoms. It also includes a user-friendly website for physicians to input patient data and utilize the predictive capabilities of the model.
